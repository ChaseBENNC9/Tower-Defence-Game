# 2) Game Mechanics - Tower Defence game.
This is the second game in the ID623001-introduction-to-algorithmic-problem-solving portfollio. It is a tower defense game where the player can spawn monster's onto specified locations on the scene. the player can use gold to upgrade the monsters and increase their damage. the goal is to complete waves of stopping the bugs from reaching the end goal cookie. Later waves will spawn in a faster enemy type and eventually a mix of both.

##Advanced assessment tasks
for the advanced tasks I attempted to use a foreach loop to go through my list and to implement multiple enemies into the waves but It caused enemies to spawn on top of eachother. I ended up using an index variable and a list. I didn't require any external research for this implementation. I do currently have an issue where the faster enemy can overtake the slower enemy as they just appear in a pattern formation. There might be a better formation for the mixed wave that can solve this.
